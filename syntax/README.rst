Syntax Highlighting for reStructuredText
========================================

In order to enable syntax highlighting for reST in GEdit v3 simply copy the file
``reST.lang`` to the language specs files of GtkSourceView (which seems to manage
highlighting for all langages in GEdit)::

    /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/

Then you can switch the highlighting manually in the footer bar of GEdit.
